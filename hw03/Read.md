This is my submission for hw03 (Proabably will make more revisions on tmp06.sh)

temp.sh is the shell file that runs the TMP101 sensors. The AlertTemp.js is called by the temp.sh.

tmp06.sh is a shell file that contintously prints the temperature. It seems to be off since I am usually getting a temperature around 55F. I will need to update this 

The EtcASketchLED.js is the new Etch-A-Sketch program. You will need five buttons, for up, down, left, right, and clear. When you clear, the color will change. Keep pressing clear to change the color.
