This is my submission for hw02

The buttonBlink.js uses f our buttons to turn on and off four leds. Pressing a button turns one of the LED's on. To use this, attach the four buttons onto the beagle bone and attach four led's to the correct pins.

The EtchASketch.js is the updated EthcaSketh program. It now uses buttons to control going up and down. I have also included an erase button. Connect five buttons to the appropriate pins to use this program. To edit the size, go withing the code and change the heigth and width values to the ones you want.
